This project conducts a comprehensive Market Basket Analysis to uncover the best-selling items and frequent product combinations across individual stores and the entire organization. Using transactional data, the code identifies product frequency and frequent itemsets through data mining techniques, offering detailed insights into customer purchasing patterns. The analysis includes store-specific and organization-wide reports presented in clean, readable tables, facilitating inventory optimization, marketing strategy development, and customer behavior analysis. Lastly, the project enables easy data upload and processing, making it a practical tool for retail decision-making and strategic planning.
